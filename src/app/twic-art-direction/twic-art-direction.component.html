        Setting up components using CSS enables hassle-free responsive designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not need to create a set of images derived from the original.
      </p>
      <p>
        You only need to manage a master image in your template: TwicPics
        understands your CSS and does the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Change the width of your browser </strong>
        to see the image ratio adapt according to the CSS rules.
